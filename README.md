# Final Project: Chat bot

My project idea is to write  a chat bot in haskell, that would work with a public API and serve some some useful information (e.g. local weather, cryptocurrency data).

## Features

1. Chat bot should be able to read a config file.
2. Based on that config, bot should work with at least two different platforms (e.g. Telegram, Discord, etc.)
3. After receiving a command defined in config, bot should fetch data from the API and respond with a fromated message.
